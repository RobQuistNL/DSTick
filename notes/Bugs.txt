Since GM won't render or do steps in the background in HTML5, but it WILL respond to the async network calls,
the game will partially continue to run on the background - not gamecode - only networking code.

Thats shit, and needs to be fixed. Either stop networking on no focus, or, best solution, continue game code while tabbed out.



> buffer_read

Replace with a safe dsnet_read() that casts to the correct type, and prevents reading-outside-buffer errors
